Basic HTML and CSS - CS50W 2019 Project 0

* This project is about four of my favourite bands
* Each band page includes introduction to its current members and lists it's studio albums along with respective release dates and playlists
* Pages are responsive and media friendly
* For all band pages there is one band.scss which generates bands.css
* Index page has few stylings which are placed in the head of the html doc
* There is a separate folder for images which are used on these pages
